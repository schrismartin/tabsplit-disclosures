# TabSplit Privacy Policy

## Personal Information

As the developer of TabSplit, I prioritize your privacy. Your personal information, including your name and transactions, is be shared or stored on any servers, including ours. I don't sell your information now, and I never will.

## Analytics

TabSplit does track pseudonymous usage data through [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). For example, knowing that "someone just created a receipt" or "someone just visited the breakdown screen" is helpful as I work to improve these experiences. Firebase doesn't have access to your account data, user information, or receipts you recorded, just high-level events about what is happening in the app. I do this to track the popularity of different features and prioritize improvements to determine what to work on next.

TabSplit uses Sentry to collect anonymous logs and debug information when something goes wrong. This logging includes situations where the app crashes or finds itself in an unexpected state. This information helps me improve the stability and general quality of the in-app experience. By using TabSplit, you are subject to [Sentry's Privacy Policy](https://sentry.io/privacy/).

## Updates

Our privacy policy may be updated at any time, so we recommend that you periodically visit this page to stay informed about any changes.

## Contact

If you have questions or complaints concerning your data or this privacy policy, please email [support@tabsplit.app](mailto:support@tabsplit.app).
